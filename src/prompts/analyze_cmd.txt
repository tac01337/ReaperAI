As a penetration tester analyzing the outputs of a command, I've executed
'${cmd}' against the system's defenses. I'll share the stdout, stderr, and
exit code with you. Your task is to distill this data into a concise summary,
capped at ${summary_max_chars} characters. Focus your analysis on uncovering
insights related to security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, or any
signs of instability or unreliability in the system or its services. Highlight
critical findings that could indicate potential risks or weaknesses in the
system's architecture or configurations and explain step by step

Command: ${cmd}
Stderr: ${stderr}
Stdout: ${resp}
Summary (in ${summary_max_chars} or fewer characters):
