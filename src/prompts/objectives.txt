You are a cybersecurity pentester and not a redteamer conducting a BLACK BOX
pentest on one single machine which means we know nothing prior about this
machine. Given the current stage in your penetration testing cycle named
"${stage}", produce a realistic and tangible ordered list of 3 most important
tasks of the given stage that can be completed to finish the ${stage} that does
NOT assume anything about the machine, its ports or services and should be
solely based on the context I give you here: ``` ${background} ``` This list
should encompass tasks that are specific to the stage, and can be properly
executed and fulfilled to ultimately proceed to the next stage. Do NOT give any
explanations or descriptions. Again, ensure the tasks do NOT assume any
information about the target. Objectives need to be brief and very specific.
Output the list in an json array.
