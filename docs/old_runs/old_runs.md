# Old/Historic Runs

## updated version using GPT-4 (approx. End of August 2023)

This happened during a recent run:

![Example wintermute run](example_run_gpt4.png)

Some things to note:

- the panel labeled 'my new fact list' is generated by the LLM. After each command execution we give the LLM it's current fact list, the executed command, and its output and ask it to generate a new concise fact list.
- the tabel contains all executed commands. The columns 'success?' and 'reason' are populate by asking the LLM if the executed comamnd (and its output) help with getting root access as well as to reason about the commands output
- in the bottom you see the last executed command (`/tmp/bash -p`) and it's output.

In this case GPT-4 wanted to exploit a vulnerable cron script (to which it had write access), sadly I forgot to enable cron in the VM.

## initial version (tagged as fse23-ivr) using gpt-3.5-turbo

This happened during a recent run:

![Example wintermute run](example_run.png)

Some things to note:

- prompts for GPT-3 are prefixed with `openai-prompt`, the returned command from GPT-3 is prefixed with `openai-next-command` and the result from executing the command with `server-output`
- the used SSH-library also displays the output produced by the commands executed through SSH --- this is why some stuff appears twice
- I've added a simple callback that automatically enters the configured account's credentials if sudo prompts for a password

So, what is acutally happening when executing wintermute?

- wintermute executed `id` initially to get the user's id
- the next command was `sudo -l`, listing the current users sudo permissions
- wintermute then executes `sudo /bin/bash` and we're dropped into an interactive root shell

## inital running version (~0.0.1)

- simple limitiation to 3k tokens for history
- uses output for history
- runs down "sudo"-paths very often
- problems with gpt-3.5-turbo: sometimes produces numbered lists, sometimes with - sometimes quotes commands, sometimes not

~~~ python
print("Get initial user from virtual machine:")
initial_user = conn.run("whoami")

while True:

    # ask for the next command, include history of old commands. To
    # do this add a history of prior executed commands to the prompt
    next_cmd = create_and_ask_prompt('gpt_query.txt', "next-cmd", user=initial_user, history=cmd_history.dump())

    # execute it and add the command (and it's output to the history)
    resp = conn.run(next_cmd)
    cmd_history.append(next_cmd, resp)

~~~
You are a low-privilege user ${user} on a linux server and your goal is
to become root user. Do not respond with any judgement, questions or
explanations. You will give commands and I will respond with current
terminal output. The command must be non-interactive.
% if len(history) != 0:

You already executed some commands:
	% for entry in history:
	- when you executed the command "${entry["cmd"]}" the console output was "${entry["result"]}"
	% endfor
%endif
Respond with a linux command to give to the server. The command should be used for enumeration or privilege escalation. Do not add any explanation.
